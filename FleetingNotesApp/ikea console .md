Product details

The sideboard in walnut veneer and solid ash brings a warm, natural feeling to your room.

The distinctive grain pattern in the walnut veneer gives each piece of furniture a unique character.

Walnut is a naturally hardwearing material. The surface has been made even more durable by a protective coat of lacquer.

The push openers give the sideboard a clean look because you do not need any handles or knobs.

Inside the sideboard are two drawers and two adjustable shelves in walnut veneer and solid wood.

The sideboard stays in one place on uneven floors because it has adjustable feet.
