Customize Obsidian to the need of your heart

CSS snippets are powerful tools to add a custom style to your Obsidian vault. They can be used to redefine various parts of the user interface such as size, position and color of different UI elements.Â 

With CSS, you can create a personalized look and feel in Obsidian that is more aligned with your personality and work style. CSS can also help you to enhance productivity and improve the overall user experience.Â

This can make the note-taking process more enjoyable and fulfilling.Â 

This article is a compilation of useful CSS snippets collected from Reddit, Obsidian Forum, & Obsidian Discord. The credit for the CSS goes to the respective creators. Iâ€™ve added a link to the original source wherever possible.Â

SourceRainbow Colored Tags

Want to add different colors to your tags instead of the default one? This CSS snippet will help you achieve that.

Rainbow ColoredÂ Folders

This CSS snippet adds eye-pleasing colors to folders in obsidianâ€™s file explorer.Â 


Source

Beautiful Blockquote

This CSS snippet is stripped from the Wiselight theme. It works better in light theme. But if you want to use it with dark theme, you can change the colors to make it suit your personal needs.Â 


Gradient Workspace

This is my personal favorite one. I prefer to use it whenever possible. It adds gradient colors to all of the vault. I actually stripped this from Royal Velvet Theme. And Iâ€™m not a pro at CSS, so it might conflict with the theme you are using.Â 

But it works for me pretty well.

I really like the visual appearance of obsidian with these bright and eye-pleasing gradient colors.Â 


If you want to get all of these CSS snippets in one place, Iâ€™ve collected them and created a vault that you can download from Buy Me a Coffee or Gumroad.
