Creating comprehensive templates that include Dataview elements and are formatted in a multi-column layout for various purposes like publishing, project management, and life planning requires a thoughtful approach to structure and content. Below are examples of such templates, incorporating front matter for linking and Dataview plugin compatibility within Obsidian. These templates also follow the multi-column format you've provided as an example.

### Notes on Implementation:

- **Front Matter:** Each template starts with YAML front matter for metadata, helping to organize and link content within your Obsidian vault.
- **Dataview Compatibility:** While these templates are structured for readability and organization, incorporating specific Dataview queries depends on your vault's structure and data. You can extend these templates with Dataview code blocks (```dataview```) to dynamically list or summarize linked pages, tasks, or any specific criteria.
- **Multi-Column Format:** The provided format mimics a multi-column layout. Obsidian's default Markdown renderer doesn't directly support multi-column layouts as HTML or CSS does, so the `> [!multi-column]` format here is illustrative. For actual multi-column support, you may need to use HTML within your Markdown or rely on specific Obsidian plugins or CSS snippets that enable such layouts.

These templates are starting points. Customize them according to your specific needs, data structure, and the plugins you have installed in Obsidian (like Templater for dynamic content or Dataview for querying your notes).
